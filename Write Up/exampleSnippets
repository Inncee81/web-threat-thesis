The idea of micro-optimization is motivated by the recent trends in computer
architecture towards low-level parallelism and small, pipelineable
instruction sets \cite{small}.  By getting rid of more
complex instructions and concentrating on optimizing frequently used
instructions, substantial increases in performance were realized.

the floating point format used is shown in figures
