# Read the data into similar structures used in training
# Collect the relevant matching bitstrings

# If the same bitstrings match, then its a match, or a false positive.
# Use the header information to figure it out, all itstrings in our training array are attack signatures)

# Log all incidents and statistics to a file or array for later use.


# Output
# Output to a file with the top of the file having a summary of all of the information, and the details of the test
