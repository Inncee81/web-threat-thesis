# Designing and Evaluating Application Layer Web Threat Detection with Supervised-Learning Techniques

My 4th year thesis dealing with examining existing and proposed techniques of detectiong SQL injections, XSS attacks and RFI attacks through existing and proposed techniques using genetic algorithms.  In addition, the genetic algorithm approach wil be compared to another supervised learning technique that has not been widely discussed for this particular use, support vector machine, a machine learned classifier.

# Libraries Used
- scikit-learn
